description: Discover and access indexed files using the MCP Resources API
---

In addition to the 3 tools, the S3 Documentation MCP server implements the standard [MCP Resources API](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/server/resources) for file discovery and direct access.

## What are MCP Resources?

MCP Resources provide a standardized way to:
- **List** all indexed files with metadata
- **Read** the full content of specific files
- **Browse** your documentation without semantic search

Think of it as a file browser for your indexed documentation.

## resources/list

Lists all indexed Markdown files with metadata.

### Response Format

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "uri": "s3doc://docs/configuration.md",
      "name": "configuration.md",
      "description": "Configuration Guide - Size: 5.4 KB, Chunks: 6, Modified: 2025-10-20",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown"
    },
    {
      "uri": "s3doc://docs/installation.md",
      "name": "installation.md",
      "description": "Installation Guide - Size: 3.2 KB, Chunks: 4, Modified: 2025-10-19",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resource Fields

- **uri**: Unique identifier in the format `s3doc://<s3_key>`
- **name**: Filename only (e.g., `configuration.md`)
- **description**: Human-readable metadata (size, chunks, last modified)
- **mimeType**: Always `text/markdown` for documentation files

### Use Cases

#### 1. Browse Available Documentation

"What documentation files are available?"

The LLM can list all indexed files and help users discover what's available.

#### 2. File Discovery

"Show me all files about configuration"

The LLM can filter resources by name or description to find relevant files.

#### 3. Navigation

"List all files in the docs/ directory"

Resources are organized by their S3 key structure.

## resources/read

Reads the full content of a specific file by its URI.

### Request Format

```json
{
  "uri": "s3doc://docs/configuration.md"
}
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "uri": "s3doc://docs/configuration.md",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown",
      "text": "# Configuration Guide\n\nThis guide explains how to configure..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### URI Format

Resources use the `s3doc://` URI scheme:

```
s3doc://<s3_key>
```

**Examples:**
- `s3doc://docs/guide.md`
- `s3doc://api/authentication.md`
- `s3doc://README.md`

The `<s3_key>` is the full path in your S3 bucket.

## Resources vs Tools

### When to Use Resources

Use Resources (`resources/list`, `resources/read`) when:
- ✅ User wants to **browse** available files
- ✅ User asks "What files do you have?"
- ✅ User wants to read a **specific known file**
- ✅ User wants to see file **metadata** (size, chunks, modified date)

### When to Use Tools

Use Tools (`search_documentation`) when:
- ✅ User asks a **question** that requires semantic search
- ✅ User wants to **find information** across multiple files
- ✅ User doesn't know which file contains the answer

### Example Comparisons

| User Query | Use | Reason |
|------------|-----|--------|
| "What files are available?" | `resources/list` | Browsing files |
| "Show me the installation.md file" | `resources/read` | Known file |
| "How do I configure S3?" | `search_documentation` | Semantic search |
| "What's in the configuration guide?" | `resources/read` | Known file |
| "Find information about Docker" | `search_documentation` | Search across files |

## Integration with LLM Clients

Most MCP clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) automatically support Resources:

### Cursor

Resources appear as available context sources. The LLM can:
- Browse the resource list
- Read specific files
- Use resources to answer questions

### Claude Desktop

Resources are listed in the "Available Resources" section. Claude can:
- Discover available documentation
- Read full files on demand
- Combine resources with semantic search

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Browsing Documentation

**User:** "What documentation files are available?"

**LLM Actions:**
1. Calls `resources/list`
2. Presents the list of files with descriptions

**Response:**
> You have 15 documentation files:
> - `configuration.md` - Configuration Guide (5.4 KB, 6 chunks)
> - `installation.md` - Installation Guide (3.2 KB, 4 chunks)
> - ...

### Example 2: Reading a Specific File

**User:** "Show me the complete installation guide"

**LLM Actions:**
1. Calls `resources/list` to find the file
2. Identifies URI: `s3doc://docs/installation.md`
3. Calls `resources/read` with that URI
4. Returns the full content

**Response:**
> Here's the complete installation guide:
> 
> [Full Markdown content]

### Example 3: Semantic Search + File Reading

**User:** "How do I configure Docker?"

**LLM Actions:**
1. Calls `search_documentation` to find relevant information
2. Finds source: `docs/installation.md`
3. Optionally calls `resources/read` to get full context
4. Provides answer with complete context

**Response:**
> According to the installation guide, here's how to configure Docker:
> 
> [Answer with full context]

## Resource Lifecycle

Resources are automatically managed by the synchronization system:

**Flow:**
```
S3 Files → refresh_index → [Vector Index + Resources Registry]
                                          ↓
                            [resources/list, resources/read]
```

### Automatic Updates

- ✅ New files in S3 → Automatically added to resources
- ✅ Modified files → Metadata updated in resources
- ✅ Deleted files → Automatically removed from resources

### Synchronization

Resources stay in sync with the vector index:
- `SYNC_MODE=startup` → Resources updated at startup
- `SYNC_MODE=periodic` → Resources updated at intervals
- `SYNC_MODE=manual` → Resources updated with `refresh_index`

## Metadata Details

Each resource includes rich metadata:

```json
{
  "uri": "s3doc://docs/configuration.md",
  "name": "configuration.md",
  "description": "Configuration Guide - Size: 5.4 KB, Chunks: 6, Modified: 2025-10-20T14:30:00.000Z",
  "mimeType": "text/markdown"
}
```

**Metadata Includes:**
- **File name**: Easy to identify
- **Size**: In human-readable format (KB, MB)
- **Chunk count**: How many chunks in the index
- **Last modified**: When the file was last updated in S3

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Use Resources to **explore** available documentation
- Use Tools to **search** for specific information
- Combine both for comprehensive answers

### For Developers

- Keep file names descriptive (good names help in `resources/list`)
- Organize files logically in S3 (reflected in URI structure)
- Update documentation regularly (sync keeps resources fresh)

## Troubleshooting

### Resource Not Found

**Error:** Resource URI not found

**Cause:** File may have been deleted from S3 after indexing

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "force": false
}
```
Run `refresh_index` to synchronize resources with S3.

### Empty Resource List

**Error:** `resources/list` returns empty array

**Cause:** No files indexed yet

**Solution:**
1. Verify files exist in S3 bucket
2. Check S3 credentials
3. Run `refresh_index` with `force: true`

### Resource Content Mismatch

**Error:** Content from `resources/read` differs from search results

**Cause:** File was modified in S3 but not yet synced

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "force": false
}
```
Run `refresh_index` to update the index.
